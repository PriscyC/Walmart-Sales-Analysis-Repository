# EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS OF WALMART SALES DATASET
The analysis focuses on sales data from Walmart stores across three cities: Yangon, Naypyitaw, and Mandalay. The dataset provides insight into customer demographics, product lines, payment methods, and sales trends. The primary objectives are to understand city-wise sales performance, product line revenue contributions, payment preferences, and spending behavior based on gender. By using SQL queries and visualizations, we uncovered key trends, such as the leading product lines and cities in terms of sales, and the distribution of payment methods.

Recommendation

Based on the analysis, Walmart can enhance profitability by optimizing product availability during high-traffic times (e.g., morning or evening peaks). Increasing stock for popular product lines in high-performing branches and cities can also improve sales. Additionally, targeted promotions by customer type and gender—leveraging insights into demographic purchasing patterns—could boost customer retention and engagement.

To further enhance performance, Walmart should monitor payment trends, offering incentives for preferred methods (like digital payments) if identified as more efficient. Finally, product lines with lower average ratings may benefit from quality improvement initiatives, fostering higher customer satisfaction and loyalty.

Implementing these strategies can support sustained growth and a customer-centric shopping experience.
