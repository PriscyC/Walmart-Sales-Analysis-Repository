The analysis focuses on sales data from Walmart stores across three cities: Yangon, Naypyitaw, and Mandalay. The dataset provides insight into customer demographics, product lines, payment methods, and sales trends. The primary objectives are to understand city-wise sales performance, product line revenue contributions, payment preferences, and spending behavior based on gender.
